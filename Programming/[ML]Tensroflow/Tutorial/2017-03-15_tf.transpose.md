From the Tensorflow example, we have  

```python
'x' --> [[[1  2  3]  
          [4  5  6]]  
         [[7  8  9]  
          [10 11 12]]  
```

tf.transpose takes two arguments  
*1) array*  
*2) perm*  

*1) array* can be any n-dimensional array/tensor  
*2) perm* can be a scalar or a vector

x.shape is (2,2,3), but after the following command  
 
```python
>> tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1])
>> [[[1  4]
     [2  5]
     [3  6]]
     
    [[7 10]
     [8 11]
     [9 12]]]
```

The output suddenly becomes shape=(2,3,2).  

**Why??**

**perm**=[0, 2, 1] means that ...  
**dimension 0** stays as **0-dimension** of the original tensor  
**dimension 1** should be replaced as **2-dimension** of the original tensor  
**dimension 2** should be replaced as **1-dimension** of the original tensor  
> The original shape is (2,2,3)  
> After perm=[0,2,1],  
> new dim0 --> original dim0 (which is 2)  
> new dim1 --> original dim2 (which is 3)  
> new dim2 --> original dim1 (which is 2)  
> new Tensor will have shape (2,3,2)
